f(1)=1; f(2)=2; f(3)=4 %need to know these elements to move forward
lastn=15 %the step we want to know has how many combinations
for i=4:lastn %where we begin to where we end
f(i)=f(i-1)+f(i-2)+f(i-3); %the function for number of ways to get to step
end
f(lastn) %display the number of ways to last n
f %display number of ways getting to all the steps (the whole vector)

n=1:lastn %a vector of steps considered
plot(1:lastn,f,'*') %creates figure
