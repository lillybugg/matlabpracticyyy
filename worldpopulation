%code for world population (optimistic point of view)
clear all

r = 0.0085;       % yearly growth rate
K = 4e10;         % carrying capacity (40 billion)
P0 = 8.1e9;       % current population

f = @(t,P) r*P*(1 - P/K); %@ means function handle. you need for ODE's

[t,P] = ode45(f,[0 50],P0); %ordinary differantial equation. 45 4th/5th order. 
%Use f start at 0 end at 50. start with pop p0
